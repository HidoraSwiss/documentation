# Hidora's docuementation

Hidora is a Swiss-based managed cloud hosting platform (PaaS). We support any PHP, Javan Python, Node.js, Ruby, .NET or Docker-based applications. 

Our service is based on the orchestration system [Jelastic](https://jelastic.com/) which proposed already a general documentation of different features.
The purpose of this website is not to recreate the same documentation than Jelastic but have other objectives : 

* complete Jelastic's documentation regarding few needs of customers or some points which are not detailed
* document what is peculiar to Hidora
* document development or additions made by Hidora on the platform

Regarding questions which are not mentionned above, please have a look on [Jelastic's documentation](https://docs.jelastic.com/)

More specifiacally :

* [Understand how the interface works](https://docs.jelastic.com/jelastic-dashboard-guide)
* [How to create an environment?](https://docs.jelastic.com/setting-up-environment)
* [Understand how the (vertical/horizontal) scaling  works](https://docs.jelastic.com/horizontal-scaling)
